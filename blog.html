                <h2>Earth, The third planet</h2>

                    Earth, our home planet, is a world unlike any other. The third planet from the sun, Earth is the only place in the known universe confirmed to host life.
                    With a radius of 3,959 miles, Earth is the fifth largest planet in our solar system, and it's the only one known for sure to have liquid water on its surface. Earth is also unique in terms of monikers. Every other solar system planet was named for a Greek or Roman deity, but for at least a thousand years, some cultures have described our world using the Germanic word “earth,” which means simply “the ground.”

                <h2>Facts about eyes</h2>
                
                <img src="./assets/images/blogi2.jpg" alt="" width="100%">

                    Our eyes are about 1 inch across and weigh about 0.25 ounce.
                    The human eye can differentiate approximately 10 million different colors.
                    Our eyes remain the same size throughout life, whereas our nose and ears never stop growing.
                    The human eye blinks an average of 4,200,000 times a year. This means if you were given a nickel for every time you blinked you would make $210,000 annually.
                    Eyes are made up of over 2 million working parts.
                    Each individual eye contains 107 million cells and all are light sensitive
                    Your eye is the fastest muscle in your body. Hence, the phrase: “In the blink of an eye.”
                    The world’s most common eye color is brown.
                    Brown eyes are blue eyes underneath. Consequently, a person can receive surgery in order to make their brown eyes blue.
                    “Don’t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue” is a song recorded by American country music artist Crystal Gayle.
                    The night vision of tigers is six times better than that of humans.
                    Ommetaphobia is the fear of eyes.
                    Pirates wore earrings because they believed it improved their eyesight.

                <h2>Facts about the Ocean</h2>

                    The ocean is home to nearly 95 percent of all life.

                    With so much going on well below the surface, it's easy to forget that the oceans are teeming with life. In fact, 94 percent of life is aquatic, according to the USA Science & Engineering Festival. That means those of us who live on land are part of a very, very small minority.

                    Coral produces its own sunscreen.

                    Too much sunlight can damage the algae that live inside coral in shallow water. To protect the algae, which are a main source of sustenance for the coral, the corals fluoresce. This creates proteins that act as a sort of sunscreen for the algae.

                    There's enough gold in the ocean for us each to have 9 pounds of it!

                    There's around 20 million tons of gold dispersed throughout the oceans. It is, however, diluted pretty much to a pulp—its concentration is only a few parts per trillion, according to the National Ocean Service. The ocean floor also has undissolved gold embedded in it, but it's not cost-effective to mine it. However, if the ocean's gold were equally distributed among every person on earth, we'd each receive nine pounds of gold.

                    There's an ice sheet larger than the continental United States.

                    Just two vestiges of ice remain from our planet's last ice age: the Greenland Ice Sheet and the Antarctic Ice Sheet. The latter of the two is staggering in size. Clocking in at 5.4 million square miles, according to the National Snow & Ice Data Center (NSIDC), it's roughly the size of the continental United States and Mexico combined!

                    Sharks have their own underwater "café."

                    It turns out, humans aren't the only creatures in need of a winter vacation. In 2002, scientists discovered an area in a remote part of the Pacific Ocean, partway between Baja California and Hawaii, where typically coastal great white sharks will migrate to in the winter. The scientists named the spot the White Shark Café and some sharks hang around the area for months before heading back to the coast for warmer weather.

                    The planet's longest mountain range is underwater and is 10 times longer than the Andes.
