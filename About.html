                <p>
                    
                        My name is Mebea Nibret. I was born in a small town called Gimja Bet in 1992 E.C. 
                        <br>
                        When I was 5 years old, I joined a school called Horizon Academy, which is found in Bahir Dar city.

                        <br>
    
                        <br>
                        I left Horizon Academy and joined Bahir Dar zuria secondary school when I became 9th grade. I have learned their till I became 11th grade. Then I left it and became a student of Bahir Dar secondary and preparatory school.
